This game was made in two weeks in order to learn C++.  

*The game & code is available on [github](https://github.com/RafaTVaz/SimplePuzzleGame/releases/tag/v1)*

*Simple game about combining Pieces in +4 clusters
Puyo like game, played alone no AI to compete with*

Everything in the game done entirely by me. 
-	Pixel Art made with Asesprite
-	Sound Effects made with DrPetter's [sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)
-	Implemented SDL with the help of LazyFoo's lovely [tutorial](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL)
