### Burden 
was my first game project. It is extremely crude but was a great learning experience, specifically in time managment and setting clear goals and expectations.  
I came up with the main idea but focused mostly on visuals. A ***fully animated*** intro and ending + ***concept art*** for all the characters and ***sprites and animations*** of all the characters.  
All this work can be seen in the following trailer:
