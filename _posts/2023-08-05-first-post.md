Manipulate objects and yourself by pulling and pushing on objects and figure out every Puzzle room. Platform your way to the exit by flinging and repulsing yourself from large objects. Pull small objects towards you and shoot them across the room.
The artstyle was heavily inpired by Simon Kaempfer artwork.
