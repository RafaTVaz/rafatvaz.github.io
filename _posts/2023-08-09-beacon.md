Understand and navigate your surroundings using only a gun whose slow bullets emit a lot of light.

### The Game
This very small game was done for a course in computer graphics. We had to use Unity to explore many different types of lighting technology such as PBR, SSR, Normal Maps etc.

The idea was to make a pitch-black game with weird surroundings one has to wander through while collecting a few bits to complete a level; the only way to get a better understanding of the level is to shoot and slowly map out the level in your head.

### My contribution 
For this project I had the main idea of exploring a pitch-black level, and what kind of effects we could use to sell that well.

There is an additional first level where we explored many other visual effects that could not be used with low or lack of light. 

The specific work I did on the game was:
- Come up with the main idea and lead the team
- Level creation
- Basic animations
- Gameplay programming
- Custom Shaders
- Post-processing + visual design
- Particle effects and visual effects
