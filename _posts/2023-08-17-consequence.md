A game created for the 2022 Games for Good  GameJam at IADE. 

This project was made to better understand how to create a simple civ game with tile-to-tile interaction.  

Project was unfinished but it was an exceptional learning experience. Many hours were spent figuring out the logic between tiles and coding that logic and interaction.
