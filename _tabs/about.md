Hello, my name is Rafael and I'm very passionate about narrative and the power of visual storytelling mediums. I've always loved drawing and since University have become fixated on video games, understanding them better and working on them.

Currently I'm finishing my master's degree at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) in *Computer Science*, where I also completed my bachelor's in *Electrical and Computer Engineering*. 
My master's degree is specialized on **_Game Development_** and **_Computer Graphics & Interaction_**.
  
  
### Games & Programing
Uni is where I learned about and how much I love **programming**, and games had been a passion of mine ever since I can remember. Working on games was an obvious choice, especially since it's such a new and innovative medium for telling good, unique stories; be it through writing, visuals, animation or mechanics.
<!-- Make HOME page the games portfolio page, and about page the home page -->

*Below is the list of technologies I have most experience with:*

**Programming languages:**  
	C/C++ | C# | GLSL | Java | OpenGL | Vulkan

**Tools/Software:**  
	Unity | Unreal Engine | Visual Studio 

### Art
**Drawing** is something I cannot live without. During Uni I took drawing lessons for 3 years at [SNBA](https://www.snba.pt/en/) where I honed my skills in anatomy, learning new techniques, freeing my hands and learning how to visually study bodies, light and space.   *More on what I've learned and drawn is on my [behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/81045663/Drawing-Lessons)* 

I've been drawing regularly since school and also have started to dabble in comics and animation. Exploring these storytelling methods is something I'm very interested in and gives me a much better understanding of Art as well.
